Collaboration Reflection

Over the course of this assignment I really enjoyed the callaborative nature of data science. I attempted to start the project early so that I could set up a schema and do alot of the grunt work of data manipulation for everyone. I posted a code snippit that transformed the data into a useable format which I hoped would set a precedent of how the data should look. I got positive reactions posting the code snippet and started a conversation in which Charles posted some of his interesting findings and opened the door for others to share as well. I think the collaboration needed to started by a few people and once sharing code was more normalized students were less afraid to do it. 

We have been taught over our education never to share code, so it took a bit of encouragement for people to get over their habbits of secrecy. Overall it was a good experience!

README

This project is a Human Centered Data Science experiment, meant to challenge the way to we use statistics to understand human centered problems. In particular, we will look at crime and its relation to COVID-19 in Denver County Colorado. The first portion of this project will look at the COVID itself, and how it was impacted by masking mandates, while the second part will seek to understand changes in crime with three main hypothesis, outlined later in this readme. This challenge is human centered because it attempts to understand human behavior with data, but only has access to an incomplete picture. This is not an ethnographic study, and thus lacks the depth as to the exact reasons why humans commit crime, but aims to support existing research by looking at trends. 

In order to use this notebook you must download 3 different datasets, keeping their original names upon downloading and moving them into the same directory as the notebook:

The RAW_us_confirmed_cases.csv file from the Kaggle repository of John Hopkins University COVID-19 data. This data is updated daily. This version was Collected on 10/30/22.

Note: This dataset is too large to push to the repository, so it is not included at initial pull!

The CDC dataset of masking mandates by county. Note that the CDC stopped collecting this policy information in September 2021.

The New York Times mask compliance survey data.

Running the project_part_1_visualization notebook with create a visualization showing the total case count, 7 day average moving derivative of cases, and the periods in which masking policies were imposed in Denver Colorado from 05-2020 to 09-2021. It will be placed in figures/cases_and_masking_viz.png

There are no intermediate data sources generated by the project_part_1_visualization notebook.

Running the project_part_2_crime notebook will generate insights about how crime changed in response to different measures implemented during the epedemic. In particular it looks at 3 hypothesis:
1) The introduction of mask mandates increased public disorder crime by 15%, as those who actively broke masking mandates put strain on police forces
2) Lock down increased domestic abuse by 20% as victims no longer could avoid their abusive partners and were more likely to be stuck in the home with them.
3) Stimulus checks reduced robbery and financial crimes by up to 10%, as people could finally put food on their tables, even for a week or two

There are no intermediate data sources generated by the project_part_2_crime notebook.

Crime in Denver County by Date was found via the Denver Open Data Catalog here: https://www.denvergov.org/opendata/dataset/city-and-county-of-denver-crime
The datasets from 2013 - current were used. With 2017-2022 being downloaded originally as crime.csv (the top most link) but renamed to crime2017-22.csv. All data should be placed in the data folder.

We consider the "begining" of the pandemic to be January 10th 2020 according to the CDC covid museum: https://www.cdc.gov/museum/timeline/covid19.html#:~:text=January%2010%2C%202020,%2DnCoV)%20on%20its%20website. 

Mask Mandate implementation dates were sourced from from: https://data.cdc.gov/Policy-Surveillance/U-S-State-and-Territorial-Public-Mask-Mandates-Fro/62d6-pm5i

Lock Down orders were sourced from: https://covid19.colorado.gov/public-health-orders-and-executive-orders 

Stimulus check rollout dates were sourced from: https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/personal-finance/stimulus-checks/#:~:text=March%2027%3A%20The%20CARES%20Act,around%205%20million%20per%20week.

Crime data was pulled from the City of Denver Open Data Catalog which is a part of the NIBRS FBI reporting system. All data should be interpretted as research, and should not be taken as 100% accurate. This project was an exercise in using statistical thinking on a human centered data science project, it was limited in scope and therefore may not have fully correct insights or assumptions.
